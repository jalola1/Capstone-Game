Peering through the glass of a local candy store, he spotted rows of vibrant treats and knew he had to taste them all. 
With a mischievous grin, Fibzi creeps into the candy store, ready to eat up every last out-of-this-world sugary delight Earth has to offer.





Help Fibzi catch as much falling candy as possible. Avoid the empty candy wrappers.
Be careful not to let too many fall or else the store owner will notice and catch Fibzi!

text = "Fibzi the alien had traveled light-years to explore Earth, hoping to learn about human life. 
But after a single taste of candy, he was hooked! Peering through the glass of a local candy 
store, he spotted rows of vibrant treats and knew he had to taste them all. With a mischievous
grin, Fibzi creeps into the candy store, ready to eat up every last out-of-this-world sugary
delight Earth has to offer.

Help Fibzi catch as much falling candy as possible. Be careful not to let too many fall or else
the store owner will notice and catch Fibzi!
